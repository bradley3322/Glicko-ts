/**
 * Glicko rating system implementation.
 * This code calculates the new Glicko rating and rating deviation for a player after a series of games.
 * The Glicko system is an improvement over the Elo rating system, allowing for more accurate ratings based on the uncertainty of a player's skill level.
 * The Glicko system uses a rating deviation (RD) to measure the uncertainty in a player's rating.
 * A lower RD indicates a more stable rating, while a higher RD indicates more uncertainty.
